timestep, the eyetracker saves series of frames, this indicates the number of the frame starting from the beginning of the capture (by session and within participant)
time, time from beginning of the experiment by participant and session (in ms)
tp, time from beginning of the experiment at the next step (basically, t+1, in ms)
